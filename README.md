# XKeys HID on Mac

Just messing around with [IOKit][url-iokit] in an attempt to write a command-line program that can toggle individual LEDs on my [X-keys 16-key programmable keypad][url-xkeys-xk-16].

Why?

We have two ways of "programming" the keypad:

1. Hardware mode, where we write a tiny program in the keypad's own mini-language and persist it to the device itself
1. Software mode, where we configure a third-party piece of software to take specific actions whenever we receive input from the keypad

We want to be able to do three things:

1. Use all of the keys
1. Run arbitrary keyboard shortcuts / macros when a key is pressed
1. Toggle individual LEDs in response to keypad input

Programming the keypad in hardware mode is the most portable since the logic lives on the keypad itself. While there *are* hardware-level functions to set the state of a specific LED to either **on** or **off**, there's no hardware-level function to toggle an individual LED. That means the state of an individual LED has to live in software. Hardware mode is **out**. üôÅ

As for software, the X-keys website recommends [ControllerMate][url-controllermate] on macOS. ControllerMate *can* toggle individual LEDs, but doesn't recognize all of the keys. Other programs like [Keyboard Maestro][url-keyboard-maestro] *do* recognize all of the keys, but don't have the ability to toggle individual LEDs.

So the plan is to write a command-line utility that can toggle individual LEDs and then tell a program like *Keyboard Maestro* to invokve the utility when a key is pressed.

## Installing

1. Clone this repo and run `make` inside the project directory
1. Plug in your XK-16

Assuming `make` worked, there are two programs in `bin/`:

- `bin/read-xkeys` will display the raw bytes sent by your X-keys keypad (useful for debugging)
- `bin/write-keys` will send raw bytes to your XK-16

See the [XK-16 data report][url-xk-16-data-report] for details on the different commands the XK-16 understands (these commands are called "reports" in USB-ese). For example, to turn the third LED on, you'd run:

```console
bin/write-xkeys 181 2 1
```

Why? Because...

- The `181` / `0xB5` byte corresponds to the **Index Based Set Backlights (Flash)** command
- The `2` byte corresponds to the 0-based index of the LED whose state you want to modify
- The `1` byte corresponds to setting the LED to **on**

You could then turn it off with:

```console
bin/write-keys 181 2 0
```

You can also specify the bytes in hexadecimal. To turn on the 3rd LED, you could run:

```console
bin/write-keys 0xB5 0x02 0x01
```

This is because `0xB5` is `181` in decimal.
